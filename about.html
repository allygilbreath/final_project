          Art has always been my language, but it was in my freshman year of high school that I found my favorite medium — graphic design. The ability to translate emotion and imagination into something tangible, using just a computer, felt limitless and electric. Over the past eight years, my work has often woven together themes of nostalgia, nature, and music, reflecting the worlds I love most. Today, I’m continuing to explore the intersection of creativity and technology as a Master’s student in UX Design at Michigan State University.
